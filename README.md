# AI Wearables for Collective Learning + Action

![Group wearing headgear sharing perception](docs/group.webp)

### WHAT WE ARE BUILDING

```python

This central goal of this project is to create multiple devices for video, audio, and sensory streaming, enabling an AI system to help coordinate an individual or collective towards a goal.

This system began development within a community of self-taught synthetic biologists engineering plants to secrete insulin and other proteins. By streaming thoughts, observations, and hardware streams, they are building a group experience. As an active observer, an AI system provides guidance to new comers and bridges knowledge to experts, speeding up the collective work.

```

```python

Exploratory Stages:

üü¶ ALPHA 1: Wearable sensory ingestion (i.e., Halo) and passive multi-modal knowledge distillation systems
‚¨úÔ∏è ALPHA 2: Passive and active A.I. guidance systems
‚¨úÔ∏è ALPHA 3: Static equipment sensory ingestion and control (i.e., lab equipment)

```

### HARDWARE/WEABLES TEMPLATES

[**HALO**](/device/halo):  [WIP] Headgear for video/audio observation streaming and bi-directional AI interactions


### CONTRIBUTING

```python

If you want to explore and contribute, open up some discssions, issues, and PRs about your wild ideas. Given this is a hardware+software pursuit, we will spend a lot of time in the Github discussions to help folks get started and explore (at least until there is a hosted version of LATTICE that is coordinating improvements through our shared experiences)

```
